I am Yu Liu (刘毓), a final-year M.S. candidate in the [School of Intelligent Science and Technology](http://hias.ucas.ac.cn/znkxyjs/index.htm), [Hangzhou Institute for Advanced Study (HIAS)](http://hias.ucas.ac.cn/), [University of Chinese Academy of Sciences (UCAS)](https://www.ucas.edu.cn/).

My research interests include LLM-based agents, multimodal reasoning, cross-modal alignment, and affective computing.

I am very fortunate to be advised by [Prof. Taihao Li](https://people.ucas.ac.cn/~0070909) and [Dr. Leyuan Qu](https://people.ucas.edu.cn/~leyuanqu).

You can find my CV here: [Yu Liu's Curriculum Vitae](../assets/Yu_Liu_CV.pdf) (Updated: Oct 24, 2025).

  <h3>Research Highlights</h3>

  <h4>Affective &amp; Social AI</h4>
  <ul>
    <li>
      <strong>Multimodal Empathetic Dialogue Agent</strong> [arXiv ’25 / T-Affective Computing <em>under review</em>] ★:
      Proposed a cross-modal alignment of <em>local–global fusion + emotion hotspot centering</em>, significantly improving conversational emotion understanding and powering a controllable talking-face generation pipeline; the emotion recognizer has also been deployed as an independent fatigue-detection prototype.
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Think-Before-Draw</strong> [<em>Pattern Recognition</em> <em>under review</em>]:
      A two-stage pipeline of <em>affective semantic decomposition → generation control</em>, achieving disentanglement and controllable synthesis of fine-grained facial expressions and speaker style.
    </li>
  </ul>

  <h4>Digital Therapeutics</h4>
  <ul>
    <li>
      <strong>HOPE: Hierarchical Vision–Language Fusion</strong> [ACM MM ’25 Grand Challenge] ★:
      Combines <em>visual biomarkers + LLM-augmented questionnaires</em> for low-resource depression detection; Youth track winner with <strong>94.51%</strong> (1.4% over runner-up; +49.14% over the baseline).
    </li>
  </ul>

  <h4>Multimodal ERC (Emotion Recognition in Conversation)</h4>
  <ul>
    <li>
      <strong>Centering Emotion Hotspots</strong> [<em>under review</em>]:
      Extends frame-level dynamics to dialogue-level cross-modal local–global fusion, improving stability and generalization for cross-turn emotion tracking.
    </li>
  </ul>

  <h4>Earlier Work: Aviation Analytics</h4>
  <ul>
    <li>
      <strong>Risk Propagation on Flight Networks</strong> [Journal ’20 → 2023 Frontrunner 5000 Top Article]:
      Introduced Spearman correlation + SIR dynamics into airline operational risk management, yielding deployable complex-network propagation analysis.
    </li>
  </ul>
