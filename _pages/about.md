I am Yu Liu (刘毓), a final-year M.S. candidate in the [School of Intelligent Science and Technology](http://hias.ucas.ac.cn/znkxyjs/index.htm), [Hangzhou Institute for Advanced Study (HIAS)](http://hias.ucas.ac.cn/), [University of Chinese Academy of Sciences (UCAS)](https://www.ucas.edu.cn/).

My research interests include LLM-based agents, multimodal reasoning, cross-modal alignment, and affective computing.

I am very fortunate to be advised by [Prof. Taihao Li](https://people.ucas.ac.cn/~0070909) and [Dr. Leyuan Qu](https://people.ucas.edu.cn/~leyuanqu).
