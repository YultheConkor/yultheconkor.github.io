I am a second-year master's student from the [School of Intelligent Science and Technology](http://hias.ucas.ac.cn/znkxyjs/index.htm), [Hangzhou Institute for Advanced Study, UCAS](http://hias.ucas.ac.cn/).

My research interests include LLM-based agents, multimodal reasoning, cross-modal alignment, and affective computing.

I am very fortunate to be advised by [Prof. Taihao Li](https://people.ucas.ac.cn/~0070909).

You can find my CV here: [Yu Liu's Curriculum Vitae](../assets/Yu_Liu_CV_251022.pdf) (Updated: Oct 22, 2025).
