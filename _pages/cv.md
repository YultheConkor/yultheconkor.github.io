Education
======
* **University of Chinese Academy of Sciences (Hangzhou Institute for Advanced Study)**  
  *M.S. in Artificial Intelligence, Sep. 2023 – Jun. 2026*  
  GPA: 3.76 / 4.0  
  Selected Coursework: Natural Language Processing; Advanced AI; Multimedia Processing; Algorithm Design & Analysis  
  Research Interests: LLM-based agents; multimodal reasoning; cross-modal alignment; affective computing  

* **Civil Aviation University of China**  
  *B.S. in Transportation, Sep. 2015 – Jun. 2019*

Research & Engineering Projects
======
* **Multimodal Empathetic Dialogue System for Social-AI Interaction** (2024 – Present)  
  - Designed & developed a persona-aware multimodal agent integrating vision, audio, and text, achieving superior perceived empathy over SOTA models (GPT-4, Gemini, DeepSeek, Qwen).  
  - Led visual processing and vision–text fusion, implementing cross-modal alignment and dynamic emotion recognition.  
  - Outcomes: IEEE TAFFC manuscript + granted Chinese patent, foundational for subsequent depression detection research.  

* **Zhejiang Vanguard Project: Digital Therapeutics for Depression Detection** (2024 – Present)  
  - Developed visual biomarker extraction system for low-resource depression detection.  
  - Designed HOPE hierarchical multimodal fusion framework for robust vision–language integration.  
  - Achieved **1st Place (94.51% accuracy)** in ACM MM 2025 MPDD Grand Challenge (Young Adult Track); lead author of accepted ACM MM 2025 paper.  

* **Data-Driven Aviation Analytics and Risk Modeling** (2020 – 2023)  
  - Proposed complex network risk propagation model, published as EI-indexed journal article, later awarded *Frontrunner 5000 Top Article (2023)*.  
  - Built Django+SQL automation platform for flight delay/fault analytics, reducing report time by 85%, adopted across multiple departments at China Southern Airlines.  
  - Transitioned from aviation to advanced data-driven analytics.

Professional Experience
======
* **Data Analyst**, Airlines Operations Center, China Southern Airlines (Sep. 2019 – May 2023)
